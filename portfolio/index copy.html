          <p class="text-lg leading-8">Tom Stimpson is a digital designer and front-end developer with more than fifteen years experience based in Nottingham, UK.</p>
          <p>Currently working at de facto, he's been involved in many high profile projects for notable clients. Since joining the studio, he's made the transition from print designer, to digital designer and front-end developer. More recently he’s been at the forefront of client management for a number of eCommerce brands liasing with their ecom managers to ensure the ongoing demands of their brand are met.</p>
          <p>As a designer, he has an exacting attention to detail and is an integral part of the development process ensuring both visual and functional demands are handled smoothly and effectively.</p>
          <p>He is always striving for clean, crisp and accessible digital design with purpose, looking to use his knowledge of eCommerce patterns to improve user experiences and deliver high functioning solutions for brands.</p>
          <p>Often working as part of a wider team, he isn't driven by ego and will always prefer an open and honest approach to his skillset, rather than overpromising and under-delivering. This has held him in good stead with both teammates and clients alike. </p>
          <p>Outside of design and dev — he has a ponchant for a bit metal, been known to run a bit, is an under-8s football coach and a dad to three gorgeous kids and one loveable Flat Coated Retriever.</p>
